# [Interfacing NTC Thermistor With Arduino]

<br>
<br>

Thermistors are simple, inexpensive, and accurate components that make it easy to get temperature data for your projects. Thermistors or THERMally sensitive resISTORs are variable resistors, whose resistance will be changed with the temperature. This feature enables us to read the temperature or change in temperature by measuring the resistance of the thermistors. Thermistors are used in various everyday use items like Thermostats, SMPS, surge protection circuits and rechargeable battery packs etc.
